A suite of packages to support Windows development with Dart.

Packages include [win32](https://github.com/dart-windows/win32), a projection of
standard Win32 and COM APIs; an [idiomatic Dart projection of the modern WinRT
APIs](https://github.com/dart-windows/dartwinrt); and a number of higher-
level packages that provide APIs for common
hardware and system capabilities such as the Windows registry, file picker and
gamepads.

General documentation can be found at https://win32.pub.

All packages are licensed permissively under the BSD-3 license, and welcome
contributions with tests.
