A suite of packages to support Windows development with Dart.

Packages include [win32](https://pub.dev/packages/win32), a projection of
standard Win32 and COM APIs, an idiomatic Dart projection of the modern WinRT
APIs, and a number of higher-level packages that provide APIs for common
hardware and system capabilities such as the Windows registry, file picker and
gamepads.

All packages are licensed permissively under the BSD-3 license, and welcome
well tested contributions.
